It looks like you wrote `+k+`(async () => ...) or returned a Promise. Instead, write the async function inside your effect and call it immediately:

`+k+`(() => {
  async function fetchData() {

    const response = await MyAPI.getData(someId);
    // ...
  }
  fetchData();
}, [someId]); // Or [] if effect doesn't need props or state
