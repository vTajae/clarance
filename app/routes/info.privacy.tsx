        Privacy and security are very important to us at International

        (“Policy”) is meant to help you (the “end user”) understand how we at

        services - for example, when you use ICM Portal, or when you use ICM to
        connect and share your data to power the applications (“apps”) you use.
        These apps, which offer many business services and products such as
        helping you manage your business, invoicing, accounts payable, accounts
        receivable and manage your revenue spending, are built and provided by
        our business customers (we'll call them “developers” here), and powered
