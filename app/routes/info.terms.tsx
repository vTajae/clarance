      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      <p>
        These Terms of Use (these “Terms”) are our rules for our production
        application environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        By clicking “I agree” (or a similar checkbox or button) or accessing or
        using the Services, you indicate your assent to be bound by these Terms.
        If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use or access the Services.
        These Terms contain mandatory arbitration provisions that require the
        use of arbitration to resolve disputes. Please read it carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
        These Terms are between International Communications Management Inc.
        (ICM), a Washington corporation (“ICM”) and a “Client” entity or person
        accessing or using ICM's application. If you are accessing or using the
        ICM application on behalf of another entity, then that entity is the
        Client. ICM may modify these Terms from time to time in accordance with
        Section 10 (Modifications) below.
      </p>
      <h2>1. ACCESS RIGHTS; RESTRICTIONS</h2>
      <h3>1.1 Access</h3>
      <p>
        Subject to the Client's compliance with the terms and conditions of
        these Terms, ICM hereby agrees that during the term of these Terms, the
        Client has the non-exclusive right to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          use the package of application programming interface materials
          provided by ICM solely as necessary to make an application owned and
          operated by the Client (the “Client Application”) interoperate with
          the ICM services.
        </li>
        <li>
          use the Services in such Client Application provided to end users
          (consumers or businesses) (the “End Users”) solely for internal
          evaluation of the Services, and
        </li>
        <li>
          All use of the Services and Output must be only as provided in these
          Terms, only in accordance with ICM's applicable technical user
          documentation and subject to the internal evaluation use case
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>10. MODIFICATIONS</h2>
      <p>
        From time to time, ICM may modify these Terms. ICM will use commercially
        reasonable efforts to notify Client of the modifications and the
        effective date of such modifications through communications via Client’s
        account, email, or other means. Client must accept the modifications to
        continue accessing or using Development Accounts. If Client objects to
        the modifications, its exclusive remedy is to cease any and all access
        and use of Development Accounts. Client may be required to click to
        accept or otherwise agree to the modified Terms in order to continue
        accessing or using the Services, and in any event continued access or
        use of the Services after the modified version of these Terms goes into
        effect will constitute Client's acceptance of such modified version.
